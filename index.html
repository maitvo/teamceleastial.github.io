        <div id="about-info">
            This mission is a part of the NASA L’SPACE Mission Concept Academy, 
            which is a NASA Lucy Program designed to teach students how to go 
            about writing and proposing a preliminary design review. 
            <br><br>
            We are students from multiple universities and colleges on the 
            East Coast, thus that’s why our name is Ce-L’EAST’-ial! 
            Click here to meet us!
            <br><br>
            Our mission was to design a mission to Mars and we were given 
            four landing sites to choose from: Jezero, NorthEast Syrtis, …, and …. 
            Our mission, which is called “Undecim Portam,” latin for “eleven's gate,” 
            referring to the Apollo 11 missions to the moon. Instead, our mission is to Mars!
            <br><br>
            Here is our mission statement:
            <br><br>
            The mission goal for Undecim Portam is to search for oxygen wells in Northeast Syrtis 
            as well as for chemical components required for life. This goal is in hopes to 
            better understand the history and geography of Mars as well as to find evidence 
            for seasonal oxygen and methane atmosphere swells through conducting subsurface 
            analysis and high-resolution photos (Shekhtman, 2019). Subsurface oxygen deposits 
            are a likely candidate for the observed seasonal increase in concentration due to 
            the drastic increases and ruling-out of atmospheric involvement (Shekhtman, 2019). 
            Additionally, liquid water, ice, novel brines, and geologic features of Mars’ 
            subsurface can be investigated. Identification of such would give further incentive 
            to explore the planet’s geologic makeup and climate relation. Sedimentary rock can 
            give insight to the history of Mars and geologic characteristics it possesses. Though 
            none of these are indicative of life, they all are required for such. Substantial 
            amounts of obtainable oxygen, water, or methane could be used for future manned 
            missions to Mars in both the realm of fuel and respiration or resource usage for 
            personnel. Subsurface data, surface images, and chemical composition data will be 
            gathered to determine the presence of oxygen wells. If the existence of oxygen wells 
            on Mars were to be discovered, techniques to access that oxygen would change future 
            Mars missions. Future missions could utilize these oxygen deposits to resupply missions 
            which would help cost cut, save weight, and preserve other precious materials and resources; 
            thus allowing the room for more space and resources to send additional science experiments 
            to Mars. The discovery of oxygen would allow humanity to better understand Mars by enabling 
            all of mankind to further explore Mars due to a potentially drastically lowered barrier to 
            the means of attainable manned voyage and other relevant scientific discoveries.
